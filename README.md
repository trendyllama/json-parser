# json-parser


Using c++ to parse json.

This is my first language parser. Json is a simple syntax and a good place to start before lexing a more complicated language, as well as, making an interpreter or compiler. Will first try to just parse everything correctly, then I will look into making this process more performant.


Later steps will be to make a python interface to this code, so that the parser can be called from python.
